# Implementation of an end to end machine learning model by Houssam BIADI
- the model was already built during the R&D phase [notebook Here](https://github.com/Houssam-BIADI/Streamlit_app/blob/main/heart_disease_notebook.ipynb).
- I used the following technlogies to deploy the model:
1. **Conda**  : to create the virtual environement.
2. **VSCode** : to write the script. 
3. **Docker** : to containerize the flask app.
4. **Heroku** : as a cloud provider.
5. **Flask**  : to create the app.
